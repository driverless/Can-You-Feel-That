"Can You Feel That" Lyrics
we don't know what the future
I'll be with you forever
right now you're not alone
cause I never let you go
(listen to me)

can you feel that
can you feel that
don't be afraid
(keep breathing)
I'll take it from here than you'll be ok
(It's not the end)

take it all
breaking the rules
I never give up even though I'll fall
